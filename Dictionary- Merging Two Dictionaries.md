## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
dict2 = {"d": 4, "e": 5, "f": 6}

merged_dict = dict1.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying dict1
merged_dict.update(dict2)

print("\nMerged Dictionary:", merged_dict)
~~~


## Output
~~~
Merged Dictionary: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6}
~~~

## Result
Thus given program is verified successfully.
